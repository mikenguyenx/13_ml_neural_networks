# Venture Funding with Neural Networks

You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given you a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, you will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables. You will do the following:

- Preprocess data for a neural network model.

- Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

- Optimize the model.

## Technologies

Programming Languages: Python 3.7.13

Interactive Development Environment: JupyterLab 


Libraries: 
- Pandas - a Python library that is used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. 
- Keras - a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow which provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for building and training deep learning models.
- TensorFlow - an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google that provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and resources for building and deploying machine learning models. 
- Sklearn - also known as Scikit-learn, which is a popular machine learning library in Python that provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

Operating System(s):  Any operating system that supports Python, including Windows & macOS.
